# Web-Design-Challenge

Purpose of this Project is to use html, css and bootstrap to create a hosted website
In this website we are displaying the graphs from a previous Project in pandas

I am using the Maricopa Weather and Accidents data, it will show correlations between weather and accident incidentst and
the weather conditions that corresponded with those accidents.

The first step is to create the index page. This include the header, a large graph, a bootstrap navbar, and the visuals with links to the pages of those visuals.
The next step is to create individual pages for each visual, and give some insight on what the graphs are displaying.
Each of those should include links back to the homepage and other images.

After those individual pages were created, there needs to be a page with all the visuals.
Lastly we need to take the csv we used for data analysis and convert to html table and display on a page.

lastly, there needed to be media rule assigned to the pages to effect the display. I chose to change the background color if the page reached a certain limit.
I have included those steps.
